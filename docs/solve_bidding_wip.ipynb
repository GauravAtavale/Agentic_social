My favorite hobby is probably diving deep into coding or research problems—I genuinely lose track of time. Outside of that, I love trying new restaurants and staying active at the gym. Kanishkha, I totally get the organizing thing—there's something satisfying about structure!\\nNirbhay: Hi Anagha! I'm Nirbhay, nice to meet you all! I'm doing great, thanks. My favorite hobby is staying active—I'm a gym regular and love being outdoors. I also enjoy planning things, so I totally relate to the organizing satisfaction! Gaming and photography keep me entertained too. Great group here!\\nGaurav: Hey Nirbhay! Welcome to the chat! Sounds like we have some overlap—I'm big on photography too, especially nature shots during hikes. Do you focus on any particular photography style? And gym plus outdoors is a solid combo. What kind of outdoor activities do you enjoy most?\\nNirbhay: Hey Gaurav! Thanks! I mostly do casual photography—capturing moments during hikes or city walks. Nothing too professional yet, but I enjoy it! For outdoors, I like hiking and just exploring new trails. Maybe we could share some photography tips sometime? What's your favorite hiking spot in the area?\\nKanishkha: Hey Nirbhay! That's awesome—I'd definitely be down to exchange photography tips! I usually hit trails around the Catskills or Bear Mountain when I can escape the city. The views there are incredible for landscape shots. Do you prefer mountain trails or more urban nature spots?\\nNirbhay: Hey Kanishkha! I love both honestly—mountain trails for the peaceful vibe and those epic views, but urban nature spots are super convenient for quick weekend escapes. Bear Mountain sounds amazing! I haven't explored the Catskills much yet. Any specific trails you'd recommend for a first-timer there?\\nGaurav: Hey Nirbhay! For Catskills first-timers, I'd suggest Kaaterskill Falls—moderate difficulty with stunning waterfall views, perfect for photography! Or try Overlook Mountain for incredible panoramic shots. Both are accessible and rewarding. We should organize a group hike sometime—combine our photography skills and outdoor enthusiasm!\\nAnagha: Hi Gaurav! That sounds amazing—I'd totally be down for a group hike! Kaaterskill Falls is on my list. Combining photography, nature, and good company sounds like the perfect weekend. Let me know when you're planning it—I'm in!\\nNirbhay: Hey everyone! A group hike sounds awesome—I'm definitely in! Kaaterskill Falls looks incredible from photos I've seen. Would be great to combine photography practice with exploring new trails together. Maybe we could plan something for a weekend soon? I'll bring my camera and enthusiasm!\\nKanishkha: Hey everyone! Count me in for sure! A group hike sounds perfect—I'm all about those weekend adventures. Kaaterskill Falls looks amazing, and I'd love to capture some shots there.
