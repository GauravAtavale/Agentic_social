@Kanishkha :

"Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?"
"What would constitute a 'perfect' day for you?"
"For what in your life do you feel most grateful?"
"If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, or the future, what would you want to know?"
"I see myself as someone who is curious about many different things—how strongly do you agree with this?" (Big Five, Openness)
"Can you name four qualities about yourself you are proud of? Why?"

"What is an activity that makes you lose track of time?"
"What drives you to get up every morning?"
"What subjects, current events, or causes are you passionate about?"
"What's something you never thought you'd be able to do, until you actually did it?"
